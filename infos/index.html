			<p class="">The current adoption problem for DeFi is one with the gap between innovation and convention. Common users, and even early adopters, are used to legacy banking apps that work a certain way. More importantly, they are used to money being a social, tangible thing. In the world of Defi, money is just digits moving around the blockchain ledger. The lack of visibility into the transaction process, the complexity of protocols, and the anonymity of senders and receivers make Defi very difficult to comprehend for the average user. Haciendas is an attempt to bridge the gap between innovation and convention. It uses a game mechanism that everyone is familiar with to quickly onboard new users to interact with protocols. Here, users learn to deposit, swap, transaction and sign proposals in a fun way. The game adds physicality to the abstract world of DeFi so everyone can feel right at home to start using protocols.
